### Remove magic codegen — move to stdlib structs or compiler functions

The compiler has hardcoded special cases that detect specific method/field names and
rewrite them. These violate the "no special treatment" rule. Each should either become
a proper `@` compiler function or move to a stdlib `.zig` struct with real fields/methods.

**1. `.new()` constructor rewriting + `collection_expr` grammar** `hard`
- Location: `codegen_exprs.zig:286-301`, `orhon.peg:440-445`
- Magic: `Type.new()` → `.{}`, `Type.new(alloc)` → `.{ .alloc = alloc }`
- Root cause: `List`, `Map`, `Set` are parsed as grammar-level `collection_expr` nodes
  (PEG rules at `orhon.peg:443-445`), not as normal identifiers from an imported module.
  The codegen for `.collection` nodes emits `.{}` — it was designed to work only with
  the `.new()` magic. Cannot remove `.new()` magic without first removing `collection_expr`
  from the grammar and making `List(i32)` parse as `collections.List(i32)` — a normal
  field access + generic call.
- Fix requires: remove `collection_expr` grammar rules, make collections normal imports,
  update all codegen/MIR/resolver paths that handle `.collection` kind. Large refactor.
- `new()` and `withAlloc()` methods added to collections.zig (ready for when grammar is fixed).

**2. `wrap()`, `sat()`, `overflow()` should be `@wrap`, `@sat`, `@overflow`** `easy`
- Location: `codegen_exprs.zig:304-316`
- Magic: Parsed as regular function calls, detected by name string comparison
- Fix: Add to PEG grammar `compiler_func_name`, `builtins.CompilerFunc` enum,
  and `generateCompilerFuncMir`. Same pattern as `@splitAt` migration.

**3. `.value` field rewriting on core types** `medium`
- Location: `codegen_exprs.zig:376-449`
- Magic: `.value` is rewritten differently per type class:
  - `thread_handle.value` → `.getValue()`
  - `thread_handle.done` → `.done()`
  - `safe_ptr.value` → `.*` (dereference)
  - `raw_ptr.value` → `[0]` (index)
  - `error_union.value` → `catch unreachable`
  - `null_union.value` → `.?`
  - `arbitrary_union.value` → `._{tag_name}`
  - `result.Error` → `@errorName(captured_err)`
- Fix: For Ptr/Handle — consider making these real Zig structs with a `.value` field
  or method so codegen doesn't need special cases. For ErrorUnion/NullUnion — these
  map to Zig's `anyerror!T` and `?T` which have no `.value` field, so some codegen
  desugaring is unavoidable. This needs design work to decide what's language-level
  vs what can be a struct.

**4. Bitfield auto-generated methods** `easy`
- Location: `codegen_decls.zig:416-423, 447-454`
- Magic: Codegen injects `has()`, `set()`, `clear()`, `toggle()` into every bitfield
- These are legitimate — bitfield is a language construct, not a stdlib type. The
  methods are part of what "bitfield" means. But they're hardcoded strings, not
  defined anywhere the user can see. Consider: is this the right design, or should
  bitfield methods be visible in a stdlib file?

## Core — Compiler Architecture

### MIR — SSA construction (Phase 4a) `hard`

Flatten MirNode tree to basic blocks, build SSA form using Braun's algorithm.
Each value gets a single definition, phi nodes at join points.

Unblocks: inlining (4b), dead code elimination (4c), constant folding (4d), MIR
caching (4e). Nothing in the optimization pipeline works without SSA.

### MIR — caching (Phase 4e) `hard`

Binary serialization/deserialization of SSA IR per module. Cache invalidation via
file content hashing. Skip annotation + lowering for unchanged modules.

### Dependency-parallel module compilation `hard`

Modules are processed sequentially in topological order. Independent modules could
be processed in parallel via a thread pool.

**Prerequisites:**
- Thread-safe `Reporter` (atomic append)
- Per-module allocators (already arena-based)
- Work-stealing queue with dependency tracking
- Careful DeclTable registration ordering for cross-module refs

---

## Core — Developer Experience

### Error message quality `medium`

- Cross-module errors should show module context
- Generic instantiation failures should show the constraint that failed
- Common mistake detection — token insertions/deletions at failure point

### Formatter — line-length awareness `medium`

Missing: wrapping for long lines, function signature breaking rules, alignment
for multi-line assignments, comment-aware formatting, configurable style.

### LSP — feature-gated passes `medium`

Gate passes by request type instead of running 1–9 on every change:
- **Completion:** passes 1–4 (parse + declarations)
- **Hover:** passes 1–5 (+ type resolution)
- **Diagnostics:** passes 1–9, debounced 100–300ms

Add cancellation tokens for in-flight analysis.

### LSP — incremental document sync `hard`

Full reparse on every keystroke. No incremental updates, no background compilation,
limited completion context.

### Source mapping for debugger `hard`

Emit `.orh.map` files mapping generated `.zig` lines back to `.orh` source.
Build a VS Code DAP adapter that reads these maps.

## Features — Language

### ~~Zig-as-module — replace bridge system~~ — DONE (v0.15.0)

Replaced the `bridge` keyword with automatic Zig module conversion. `.zig` files in
`src/` are auto-discovered, parsed with `std.zig.Ast`, and converted to Orhon modules.
Bridge keyword, grammar, and all infrastructure removed. 27 stdlib `.orh` bridge files
deleted. See `docs/14-zig-bridge.md` for the new system.

### ~~String → str rename, std::str → std::string~~ — DONE

Renamed the `String` type to `str` (lowercase, consistent with other primitives). Renamed the
`str` stdlib module to `string`. Removed all string magic: auto-import, method dispatch rewriting,
`==`/`!=` rewriting, split/splitAt destructuring. Added `equals()` to string library. `==` on `str`
is now a compile error with helpful message.

### ~~Per-module `.zon` build config — replace `#cimport`~~ — DONE (v0.15.1)

Replaced `#cimport` with paired `.zon` files. C build config now lives in the Zig
ecosystem. `#cimport` grammar, parser, and pipeline extraction removed.
See `docs/14-zig-bridge.md` for `.zon` config reference.

### Compiler cleanup — string-to-enum conversions

Replace string-based dispatch with enums throughout the compiler. Gives exhaustiveness
checking, typo safety, and better performance.

**~~Metadata field enum~~** — DONE
- Added `parser.MetadataField` enum (`.build`, `.name`, `.version`, `.dep`, `.description`, `.unknown`)
- `StaticStringMap` lookup in `parse()`. All 12 string comparisons replaced across 5 files.

**~~Operator enum~~** — DONE
- Added `parser.Operator` enum (30 variants) with `parse()`, `toZig()`, `isComparison()`, `isLogical()`
- Replaced `op: []const u8` in BinaryOp, UnaryOp, and MirNode with `Operator`
- Removed `constants.Op` struct — all string comparisons replaced across 14 files

**~~Build type enum in pipeline~~** — DONE
- `MultiTarget.build_type` changed from `[]const u8` to `module.BuildType` enum
- Added `module.parseBuildType()` with `StaticStringMap`. All string comparisons replaced.

**~~PEG rule dispatch~~** — DONE
- Replaced 70+ sequential string comparisons with `StaticStringMap(BuilderFn)` dispatch table
- 3 inline builders for break/continue/null. `buildBinaryExpr` third param removed (was unused).

### Compiler cleanup — deduplication and extraction

**~~Pipeline multi/single-target unification~~** — DONE
- Removed duplicate single-target build path (~130 lines). All builds now use unified
  multi-target path — single-target is just one entry in the `MultiTarget` slice.
- Fixed latent use-after-free: `../../`-prefixed strings now outlive `buildAll` call.

**~~`stripQuotes()` utility~~** — DONE
- Extracted to `constants.stripQuotes()`, replaced 6 call sites across 4 files

**Break up oversized functions:** `medium`
- `generateExprMir()` in codegen_exprs.zig — 537 lines, one giant switch
- Split into per-expression-kind functions (binary, call, field, index, etc.)
- Files: codegen/codegen_exprs.zig

### ~~Compiler simplifications — hub+satellite splits~~ — ALL DONE

All files under 1000 lines. Resolver, pipeline, mir_annotator, module, borrow,
ownership all split into hub + satellite files.

## Features — Tooling & Ecosystem

### Binding generator `hard`

Auto-generate Zig module wrappers from C headers:
```bash
orhon bindgen vulkan.h --module vulkan
```

### Tree-sitter grammar `medium`

Enables syntax highlighting in Neovim, Helix, Zed, and other editors beyond VS Code.

### ~~PEG syntax documentation generator~~ — DONE

`orhon syntax` command generates `docs/syntax.md` from the embedded PEG grammar.
Parses sections, rules, comments, and `{label:}` annotations. 1040-line reference.

### Web playground `hard`

Online sandbox to try Orhon without installing. Already targets `wasm32-freestanding`.
Single biggest adoption accelerator for new languages.

### Debugger integration `hard`

Debug symbol generation, GDB/LLDB line mapping from generated Zig back to `.orh`
source. See also: source mapping in Developer Experience section.

---

## Optimization Passes (require SSA — Phase 4a)

### Inlining (Phase 4b) `hard`

Inline Zig module wrappers, single-expression functions, coercion wrappers at call sites.

### Dead code elimination (Phase 4c) `hard`

If an SSA value has no uses, delete it. Reachability analysis from entry points.

### Type-aware constant folding (Phase 4d) `hard`

Fold `@type(x) == T` when statically known, eliminate redundant wrap/unwrap chains,
simplify coercion sequences.

---

## Testing Improvements

### Property-based pipeline testing `medium`

- Parse then pretty-print should round-trip
- Type-checking the same input twice should give identical results
- Codegen output should always be valid Zig (`zig ast-check`)

---

## Architectural Decisions (Settled)

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Fix bugs before architecture work | Correctness before performance/elegance |
| Const auto-borrow via MIR annotation | Re-derive const-ness from AST, avoid coupling to ownership checker |
| Type-directed pointer coercion | Type annotation carries safety level |
| Transparent (structural) type aliases | `Speed == i32`, not a distinct nominal type |
| Allocator via `.new(alloc)`, not generic param | Keeps generics pure (types only) |
| SMP as default allocator | GeneralPurposeAllocator optimized for general use |
| Zig-as-module for Zig interop | `.zig` files auto-convert to Orhon modules |
| `throw` not `try` for error propagation | Less noisy, less hidden control flow |
| Parenthesized guard syntax `(x if expr)` | Consistent with syntax containment rule |
| Hub + satellite split pattern | All large file splits use same pattern for consistency |
| `blueprint` for traits, not `impl` blocks | Everything visible at the definition site |
| No Zig IR layer in codegen | Direct string emission. MIR/SSA is the optimization target |

---

## Explicitly NOT Adding

| Feature | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| Macros | `compt` covers the use cases without readability costs |
| Algebraic effects | Too complex. Union-based errors + Zig module I/O is sufficient |
| Row polymorphism / structural typing | Contradicts Orhon's nominal type system |
| Garbage collection | Contradicts systems language positioning. Explicit allocators |
| Exceptions | Union-based errors are better for compiled languages |
| Operator overloading | Leads to unreadable code. Named methods are clearer |
| Multiple inheritance | Composition via struct embedding is sufficient |
| Implicit conversions | Explicit `@cast()` is correct. Implicit conversions cause subtle bugs |
| Refinement types | Struct-validation pattern already covers this |
| Full Polonius borrow checker | Overkill. NLL gives 85% of the benefit for 30% of the work |
| Zig IR layer in codegen | Would model Zig semantics inside the compiler |
| Arena allocator pairing syntax | `.new(alloc)` already covers composed allocators via Zig module |
| `#derive` auto-generation | Blueprints require explicit implementation. No implicit anything |
| `#extern` / `#packed` struct layout | `.zig` modules already support these natively |
| `async` keyword | Wait for Zig's new async design, then map cleanly. `thread` + `Atomic` covers parallelism |
| `capture()` / closures | No anonymous functions. State passed as arguments — explicit, obvious |
