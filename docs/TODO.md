# Orhon — TODO

Items ordered by importance and how much they unblock future work.

## Core — Language Ergonomics

### Data-carrying enums (tagged unions) `hard`

Specced in `docs/10-structs-enums.md` (lines 145-150) but broken across the pipeline.
Variant field information is dropped at every stage:

1. **EnumSig** (`declarations.zig`) — only stores variant names, no field info
2. **MIR lowerer** (`mir_lowerer.zig:570-577`) — copies only name/value, drops fields
3. **Codegen** (`codegen_decls.zig:286-318`) — always emits `enum(backing)`, never `union(enum(backing))`
4. **Resolver** — no validation of variant field types

Needs a vertical slice: extend EnumSig with VariantSig (fields list), carry fields
through MIR, emit `union(enum(backing))` in codegen for data-carrying variants,
validate field types in resolver. Also: reject variants that have both data fields
AND explicit integer discriminants (currently produces confusing Zig error).

Simple value enums work correctly — this only affects data-carrying variants.

### Review metadata directives (`#name`, `#version`, `#build`, `#dep`) `medium`

All metadata directives need to be looked at together. Questions:
- Should `#dep` move to `.zon` files (like C deps already do)?
- Is `#dep` tested? (Currently zero tests)
- Are `#name`, `#version`, `#build` the right set, or should some move to `.zon`?
- Should metadata be unified into one system instead of split between `#` directives and `.zon`?

Not blocking zero-magic work — metadata doesn't touch codegen. But needs a design pass.

### For-loop tuple captures `medium`

Specced in `docs/07-control-flow.md` (line 29+): `for(my_map) |(key, value)| {}`.
AST has `is_tuple_capture` field in `ForStmt` but it's never set by the PEG builder.
The builder conflates tuple elements with index variables. Codegen only uses the first
capture element. Needs:
- Builder: detect parenthesized capture form, set `is_tuple_capture = true`
- Resolver: type-check both capture variables from map/set element types
- Codegen: emit Zig destructure pattern for tuple captures
- Blocked on std::collections having iterable map/set types

### Mixed numeric type checking and for-loop index type `medium`

The spec says "mixing numeric types is a compile error" but the check is not yet
enforced. Design decision needed on automatic widening rules:

**Same-family widening (automatic, lossless):**
- `i32 + i64` → `i64`, `f32 + f64` → `f64`, `u8 + u32` → `u32`

**Cross-family mixing (require `@cast`):**
- `i32 + f64` → error (int/float)
- `u32 + i32` → error (signed/unsigned)
- `usize + i32` → error (platform-dependent size)

Also blocked on for-loop index type — currently `usize`. Options:
- Typed index: `for (arr) |val, i: i32| { }`
- Default index to `i32` instead of `usize`
- Keep `usize` and require explicit `@cast`

Once resolved, enable mixed numeric type checking in `resolver_exprs.zig`.

### std::thread limitations `medium`

Known Zig comptime friction with Orhon codegen:
- **No top-level `spawn()` convenience** — Zig-to-Orhon converter can't handle `anytype` params.
  Users must write `thread.Thread(i32).spawn(func, arg)` instead of `thread.spawn(func, arg)`.
- **spawn/spawn2 arity split** — `spawn(func, arg)` for 1-arg, `spawn2(func, a, b)` for 2-arg.
  Zig's `@call` needs a tuple but Orhon passes individual values. Needs spawn3+ for more args.

### Tuple math (element-wise arithmetic, scalar broadcast) `hard` — DEFERRED

Specced in `docs/04-operators.md` but not implemented. Needs codegen expansion to
per-field operations and scalar broadcast wrapping. No current use cases in Tamga.

### Reject positional struct constructors `easy`

The spec says "Named instantiation always" for structs, but the resolver doesn't
reject `Player(42, "hero")` — it passes through and fails at Zig compilation with
a confusing error. Add a check: when a call targets a known struct name and args
have no names, report "struct constructors require named arguments."

### Spec: clarify `var` inside structs `easy`

`docs/10-structs-enums.md` line 11 shows `var defaultHealth: f32 = 100.0` (mutable static),
but lines 103-108 say "Only `const` is supported." The compiler accepts both.
Decide which is correct and update the spec + add validation if needed.

### Automatic error propagation `medium`

`propagation.zig:374-376` comments say unhandled error unions in error-returning
functions will "automatically propagate with trace." But no codegen implements this.
Unhandled `(Error | T)` in a function returning `(Error | T)` is silently allowed
but the error value is discarded at runtime. Either implement auto-propagation
(insert `try`-like unwrap in codegen) or always reject unhandled unions.

### `throw` narrowing for direct variable use `medium`

After `throw result`, the variable should be narrowed to `T` for direct use.
Currently `throw` emits the error check but doesn't unwrap the variable —
`var x: i32 = result` after `throw` produces invalid Zig because `result` is
still `anyerror!i32`. Only `result.i32` / `result.value` works (via explicit unwrap).

### `(null | Error | T)` TypeClass classification `easy`

`mir_types.zig` classifies combined null+error unions as `.error_union` because the
Error check runs first. The null component may not unwrap correctly. Need a combined
TypeClass or two-pass unwrap pattern.

### Spec: clarify reference types in variable declarations `easy`

`docs/09-memory.md` line 82 shows `const ref: const& MyStruct = const& data` as valid NLL
syntax, but the resolver (pass 5) rejects all `type_ptr` in variable declarations with
"reference type not allowed in variable declaration." Either update the spec to remove
the example, or change the resolver to allow it.

### Interpolated string ownership/borrow checking `easy`

Variables used inside interpolated strings (`"hello @{name}"`) are not checked for
use-after-move or active-mutable-borrow violations. Both checkers fall through to
`else => {}` for `interpolated_string` nodes. Add handling that walks `.expr` parts.

### Borrow checker dead code: type-annotation-based mutability `easy`

`borrow_checks.zig` var_decl handler had logic to derive borrow mutability from the type
annotation (`isMutableBorrowType`). Since the resolver rejects `type_ptr` in var decls
before the borrow checker runs, this path was never reachable. The `mut_borrow_expr`
expression now correctly determines mutability. Clean up any remaining dead branches.

### `compt for` — implement grammar and builder `medium`

Spec documents `compt for(fields) |field| { ... }` but grammar only supports
`compt func`. `ForStmt.is_compt` field exists, codegen handles it (`inline for`),
but builder hardcodes `is_compt = false`. Need to add `'compt'?` prefix to `for_stmt`
grammar rule and set the flag in the builder.

### Remove dead `is_compt` codegen paths for var_decl `easy`

Dead codegen paths exist in `codegen_decls.zig:345` and `codegen_stmts.zig:59` for
`is_compt` on var_decl, but no parser path ever sets this flag. `compt const` is
unnecessary — top-level `const` with comptime-known values is automatically
compile-time in Zig. Remove the dead code.

### `any` param in type-generating compt → wrong Zig type `easy`

`codegen_decls.zig:94` maps `any` parameter in type-generating compt functions to
`comptime name: type`, but `any` means "any value" not "any type." Should be
`comptime name: anytype` for value parameters. Only `type` annotation should map
to `comptime T: type`.

### Consuming method calls not tracked by ownership checker `medium`

Methods with `self: T` (by value, not borrow) should move the receiver and mark it
invalid after the call. Currently `ownership_checks.zig:204` always passes
`is_borrow=true` for method receivers. `p.destroy(); p.use()` is not caught.
Needs: look up method signature, check if self param is by value, mark receiver moved.

### Method/cross-module call argument count validation `easy`

`resolver_exprs.zig:198` looks up method signatures for return type but doesn't
validate argument count. Direct identifier calls (line 175) do validate. Add the
same arity check for `field_expr` callee paths (method calls and `module.func()` calls).

### Interpolated strings in non-hoisted positions produce invalid Zig `medium`

`findInterpolation` in `mir_lowerer.zig` only hoists interpolated strings in var_decl,
call args, assignment, and return. In other positions (if conditions, binary exprs,
match arms), the codegen fallback emits the temp var after its use, producing invalid
Zig (use-before-declaration). Either expand `findInterpolation` to recurse all
expression positions, or restructure pre_stmts flushing.

### Array literal resolver returns element type, not array type `medium`

`resolver_exprs.zig:393` returns the first element's type (e.g., `i32`) instead of
an array type. This breaks `array_to_slice` coercion detection in the MIR annotator.
`var arr: []i32 = [1, 2, 3]` likely produces invalid Zig. Fix: return a proper array
resolved type, or special-case array literal nodes in coercion detection.

### Cross-module arbitrary union type mismatch `medium`

When a function in module A returns an arbitrary union type (e.g., `(i32 | str)`) and
module B calls it, codegen generates two separate Zig union types with different names
(e.g., `test_arb_union_cross__union_24527` vs `make_union_val__union_24528`). Zig rejects
the type mismatch. Reproduction: `tester.orh` functions `test_arb_union_cross` and
`test_arb_union_inferred` — both fail with "expected type X, found Y" at Zig compilation.
Root cause: the union registry generates function-scoped union names; cross-module calls
need unified union type names. The `arb_union_cross` and `arb_union_inferred` tests in
`tester.orh` are blocked on this bug and cannot be added to `tester_main.orh` until fixed.

### Tuple literal resolver returns RT.inferred `easy`

`resolver_exprs.zig:403` returns `RT.inferred` for tuple literals. Downstream passes
have no composite type info for tuples in expression position (function args, returns).

### Unclosed `@{` in string produces no error `easy`

If a user writes `"hello @{name"` (missing `}`), the builder silently treats the
`@{name` text as a literal string part. Should report a parse error.

### Resolver: type-check test bodies `medium`

The resolver (pass 5) has no `.test_decl` arm — test bodies are entirely skipped.
Type errors in tests are only caught at Zig compilation (pass 12). Cannot simply
add a test_decl case because the resolver runs per-file and test bodies reference
functions from other files in the same module. Needs cross-file module scope support
in the resolver first.

### Import error messages lack source locations `easy`

Three import-related errors pass `null` for location:
- `module_parse.zig:205` — "module not found" for `std::` imports
- `module.zig:404` — "module not found — add X.orh"
- `module_parse.zig:192` — "unknown import scope"
These should include file/line from the import AST node.

### `@wrap`/`@sat` silently drop for div/mod operators `easy`

`codegen_match.zig` maps `@wrap(a + b)` to wrapping add, but returns null for `/` and
`%` (Zig has no wrapping variants for these). The builtin semantics are silently dropped.
Either reject unsupported operators in the resolver, or emit a warning.

### Unknown compiler function produces Zig comment, not error `easy`

`codegen_match.zig:552` emits `/* unknown @name */` for unrecognized compiler function
names. Should report an error in the resolver instead. Currently the parser limits
names to the known set, but a validation in the resolver would be defense-in-depth.

### Partial field move detection `medium`

Ownership pass claims to enforce struct atomicity (no partial field moves) but has no
field-access tracking. `let b = player.name` moves a single field without error.
Either implement field-level ownership states or document the limitation.

### Self outside struct scope `easy`

`Self` is accepted as a valid type everywhere (even outside structs) because the resolver
can't distinguish struct-method context from top-level. Would need `struct_depth` tracking
for anonymous structs in compt functions too. Currently codegen handles this correctly
(only maps Self → @This() inside structs), so invalid usage produces a Zig error.

### Bitfield as pure Orhon std module `hard` — DEFERRED

- Design: enum-based API — `Bitfield(Perm)` wraps a user enum, maps variants to bit positions
- Must be implemented as a pure Orhon module in std, not Zig
- **Blockers:**
  1. Compt iteration over enum variants
  2. Compt arithmetic (`1 << index` at compile time)
  3. Compt `@intFromEnum` equivalent
- Users can create bitfields manually with `u32` + bitwise operators in the meantime

### Stdlib cache not invalidated on compiler upgrade `easy`

`std_bundle.zig:writeStdFile()` skips writing if the file already exists in
`.orh-cache/std/`. When a user upgrades the compiler, the cached stdlib files
from the old version are never overwritten — the new compiler runs with stale
stdlib code. Fix: compare embedded content hash with cached file hash, or
always overwrite, or add a version stamp to the cache directory.

### Named tuple nominal typing `medium`

Spec says named tuples are nominally typed (two tuples with identical structure but
different names are different types). Current codegen emits anonymous Zig structs
(`struct { x: f32, y: f32 }`), which are structurally typed — no type distinction
between `Point` and `Velocity` with the same fields.

Fix: emit named struct constants instead of inline anonymous structs.

### Dead NodeKind variants: `type_primitive`, `type_tuple_anon` `easy`

`type_primitive` and `type_tuple_anon` exist in `parser.zig` NodeKind but are never
produced by any PEG builder function. `type_tuple_anon` has contradictory handling
in `types.zig` (treated as union) vs `codegen.zig` (treated as struct). Remove both
variants or implement them if needed.

### Break up oversized functions `medium`

- `generateExprMir()` in codegen_exprs.zig — 537 lines, one giant switch
- Split into per-expression-kind functions (binary, call, field, index, etc.)

### Deduplicate pipeline/LSP module resolution sequence `medium`

`pipeline.zig` and `lsp/lsp_analysis.zig` both duplicate the same module resolution
sequence: scan → parse → circular import check → validate imports. Extract into a
shared function (e.g., `Resolver.resolveAll()`) that both call.

## Core — Compiler Architecture

### MIR — SSA construction (Phase 4a) `hard`

Flatten MirNode tree to basic blocks, build SSA form using Braun's algorithm.
Each value gets a single definition, phi nodes at join points.

Unblocks: inlining (4b), dead code elimination (4c), constant folding (4d), MIR
caching (4e). Nothing in the optimization pipeline works without SSA.

### MIR — caching (Phase 4e) `hard`

Binary serialization/deserialization of SSA IR per module. Cache invalidation via
file content hashing. Skip annotation + lowering for unchanged modules.

### Dependency-parallel module compilation `hard`

Modules are processed sequentially in topological order. Independent modules could
be processed in parallel via a thread pool.

**Prerequisites:**
- Thread-safe `Reporter` (atomic append)
- Per-module allocators (already arena-based)
- Work-stealing queue with dependency tracking
- Careful DeclTable registration ordering for cross-module refs

---

## Core — Developer Experience

### Error message quality `medium`

- Cross-module errors should show module context
- Generic instantiation failures should show the constraint that failed
- Common mistake detection — token insertions/deletions at failure point
- `else if` → suggest `elif` (currently produces generic parse error expecting `{`)

### Formatter — line-length awareness `medium`

Missing: wrapping for long lines, function signature breaking rules, alignment
for multi-line assignments, comment-aware formatting, configurable style.

### LSP — foldingRange brace stack overflow `easy`

`lsp_view.zig:handleFoldingRange` uses a fixed `[256]usize` brace stack with no bounds
check. Deeply nested code (>256 levels of `{`) would cause an out-of-bounds write.
Fix: check `brace_depth < 256` before pushing, or use a dynamic list.

### LSP — feature-gated passes `medium`

Gate passes by request type instead of running 1–9 on every change:
- **Completion:** passes 1–4 (parse + declarations)
- **Hover:** passes 1–5 (+ type resolution)
- **Diagnostics:** passes 1–9, debounced 100–300ms

Add cancellation tokens for in-flight analysis.

### LSP — incremental document sync `hard`

Full reparse on every keystroke. No incremental updates, no background compilation,
limited completion context.

### Source mapping for debugger `hard`

Emit `.orh.map` files mapping generated `.zig` lines back to `.orh` source.
Build a VS Code DAP adapter that reads these maps.

---

## Features — Tooling & Ecosystem

### Binding generator `hard`

Auto-generate Zig module wrappers from C headers:
```bash
orhon bindgen vulkan.h --module vulkan
```

### Tree-sitter grammar `medium`

Enables syntax highlighting in Neovim, Helix, Zed, and other editors beyond VS Code.

### Web playground `hard`

Online sandbox to try Orhon without installing. Already targets `wasm32-freestanding`.
Single biggest adoption accelerator for new languages.

### Debugger integration `hard`

Debug symbol generation, GDB/LLDB line mapping from generated Zig back to `.orh`
source. See also: source mapping in Developer Experience section.

---

## Optimization Passes (require SSA — Phase 4a)

### Inlining (Phase 4b) `hard`

Inline Zig module wrappers, single-expression functions, coercion wrappers at call sites.

### Dead code elimination (Phase 4c) `hard`

If an SSA value has no uses, delete it. Reachability analysis from entry points.

### Type-aware constant folding (Phase 4d) `hard`

Fold `@type(x) == T` when statically known, eliminate redundant wrap/unwrap chains,
simplify coercion sequences.

---

## Testing Improvements

### Untested CLI commands `easy`

`orhon analysis`, `orhon gendoc`, and `orhon build -zig` have zero tests (unit or
integration). Any of these could break silently. Add to `test/03_cli.sh`:
- `orhon analysis` on a valid fixture → verify PASS output
- `orhon gendoc -syntax` → verify `docs/syntax.md` produced
- `orhon build -zig` → verify `bin/zig/` directory created

### Missing negative test fixtures `easy`

Several error paths have no integration test fixture:
- Circular imports — no `fail_circular.orh` (module A imports B, B imports A)
- `struct main {}` in exe module — `validateMainReserved` non-function branch untested
- `orhon init "bad name!"` — name validation exists but no test verifies rejection

### Incremental cache skip verification `medium`

`test/05_compile.sh` only checks that rebuild succeeds and hashes file exists.
It does not verify that unchanged modules are actually skipped. Add a test that
builds twice without changes and verifies generated `.zig` timestamps are unchanged.

### Property-based pipeline testing `medium`

- Parse then pretty-print should round-trip
- Type-checking the same input twice should give identical results
- Codegen output should always be valid Zig (`zig ast-check`)

## Architectural Decisions (Settled)

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Fix bugs before architecture work | Correctness before performance/elegance |
| Const auto-borrow via MIR annotation | Re-derive const-ness from AST, avoid coupling to ownership checker |
| Pointers in std, not compiler | Borrows handle safe refs; std::ptr is the escape hatch |
| Transparent (structural) type aliases | `Speed == i32`, not a distinct nominal type |
| Allocator via `.new(alloc)`, not generic param | Keeps generics pure (types only) |
| SMP as default allocator | GeneralPurposeAllocator optimized for general use |
| Zig-as-module for Zig interop | `.zig` files auto-convert to Orhon modules |
| `throw` not `try` for error propagation | Less noisy, less hidden control flow |
| Parenthesized guard syntax `(x if expr)` | Consistent with syntax containment rule |
| Hub + satellite split pattern | All large file splits use same pattern for consistency |
| `blueprint` for traits, not `impl` blocks | Everything visible at the definition site |
| No Zig IR layer in codegen | Direct string emission. MIR/SSA is the optimization target |

---

## Explicitly NOT Adding

| Feature | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| Macros | `compt` covers the use cases without readability costs |
| Algebraic effects | Too complex. Union-based errors + Zig module I/O is sufficient |
| Row polymorphism / structural typing | Contradicts Orhon's nominal type system |
| Garbage collection | Contradicts systems language positioning. Explicit allocators |
| Exceptions | Union-based errors are better for compiled languages |
| Operator overloading | Leads to unreadable code. Named methods are clearer |
| Multiple inheritance | Composition via struct embedding is sufficient |
| Implicit conversions | Explicit `@cast()` is correct. Implicit conversions cause subtle bugs |
| Refinement types | Struct-validation pattern already covers this |
| Full Polonius borrow checker | Overkill. NLL gives 85% of the benefit for 30% of the work |
| Zig IR layer in codegen | Would model Zig semantics inside the compiler |
| Arena allocator pairing syntax | `.new(alloc)` already covers composed allocators via Zig module |
| `#derive` auto-generation | Blueprints require explicit implementation. No implicit anything |
| `#extern` / `#packed` struct layout | `.zig` modules already support these natively |
| `async` keyword | Wait for Zig's new async design, then map cleanly. `std::thread` + `thread.Atomic` covers parallelism |
| `capture()` / closures | No anonymous functions. State passed as arguments — explicit, obvious |
